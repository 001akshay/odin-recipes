        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Gujarati Kadhi is a sweet tangy yogurt-based dish made with gram flour, spices, herbs and seasonings. This easy variant of kadhi is made without gram flour fritters.
             It makes for a quick comfortinng lunch or dinner paired with a side of steamed basmati rice or roti. Kadhi is a yogurt-based gravy dish to which gram flour is added,
              tempered and then simmered with spices. The addition of gram flour helps to thicken and also preventsthe curd from separating or splitting while cooking. It also adds 
              a creamy consistency.
